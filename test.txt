Shut your mouth and open your eyes,
I've got firecat kicks and they come in disguise.
Getting back all jacked and smacked.
Had my eye on you before you thought to act.
Turn in up!
Look out fool 'cause you never see me coming, bitch!
Ah, so you better get to runnin'.
Oh yeah!
Come on, kick it, kick it.
I've been doing this from dawn and back again,
Always for the win not even gonna pretend.
Listen this is war, you are gonna hit the floor.
Be blastin' like, blastin' like, blastin' ma or... or
I...
I'm watching every move
You make
Look out I'm gonna knock you down.
I...
I know you wanna survive
But I ain't gonna let you 'cause
This life is right in front of me.
You think you can beat me but now you'll see.
I ain't gonna let you win baby
You come around I'll knock you down.
Touch me and I'll break your face.
Woo
Oh yeah!
Yeah, alright lets do it.
I'm hard, I'm fast.
I'm a bona fide killer.
Don't think its a whirl when you hear me stir
Cause that's just my trigger (put your hands up)
Please man, I'm outta your league
You know its game on when you're coming at me.
No mercy, got a mind for it.
But rest assured you're gonna beg for it.
Steady your composure
No crying when its over
Standing up straight brushing dust off my shoulder
Shut you mouth and open your eyes
I got firecat kicks and they come in disguise.
