Shut your mouth and open your eyes. I've got firecat kicks and they come in disguise. Getting back all jacked and smacked.
Had my eye on you before you thought to act. Turn in up! Look out fool 'cause you never see me coming, bitch!
Ah, so you better get to runnin'.
Oh yeah! Come on, kick it, kick it. I've been doing this from dawn and back again, always for the win not even gonna pretend.
Listen this is war, you are gonna hit the floor. This life is right in front of me. You think you can beat me but now you'll see.
I ain't gonna let you win baby You come around I'll knock you down.
I got firecat kicks and they come in disguise.
